/**
 * A Call Collapser is a mechanism of network optimization that prevents repetitive consecutive
 * HTTP requests that would most probably return the same response from the network.
 * <p>
 * It enqueues requests of the same type so only one HTTP request is sent over the network but
 * every local callback gets notified as if they have made the request.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Making several consecutive GET HTTP requests to "www.example.com/v1/users/$userID"
 * in a short interval will probably result in the same user data being retrieved. A Call Collapser
 * would instead make only one HTTP request and return the same result to every local caller.
